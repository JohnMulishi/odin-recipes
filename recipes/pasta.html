  <p><strong>Pasta</strong></p> <br>
  <p>Pasta is a staple food of Italian cuisine, made from wheat flour and water, and sometimes eggs. It comes in various shapes and sizes, such as spaghetti, penne, fusilli, and lasagna. Pasta can be served with a wide range of sauces, from simple olive oil and garlic to rich tomato or cream-based sauces. It is versatile and can be paired with vegetables, meats, or seafood, making it a favorite dish worldwide.</p>
  <p>Whether enjoyed in a hearty Bolognese, a light Aglio e Olio, or a creamy Carbonara, pasta is loved for its comforting texture and ability to absorb flavors. It can be cooked al dente for a firmer bite or simmered longer for a softer texture. Pasta dishes are often garnished with cheese, herbs, or spices to enhance their flavor.</p>
